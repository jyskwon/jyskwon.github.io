I am a PhD student in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.
I am advised by <a href="http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~wlasecki/">Prof. Walter S. Lasecki</a> and am a member of <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~wlasecki/croma.html">CRO+MA Lab</a>.
I am currently at KAIST as a visiting student in <a href="https://kixlab.github.io/">KIXLAB</a> working with <a href="https://juhokim.com/">Prof. Juho Kim</a>.<br/>
My research interest spans human-computer interaction (HCI), crowdsourcing, machine learning, and digital image processing.
